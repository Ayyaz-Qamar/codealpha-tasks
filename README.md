## Task 1: Credit Scoring Model

**Objective:** Predict an individual's creditworthiness using past financial data.

**Approach:**

* Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
* Feature engineering from financial history.
* Model evaluation using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

**Key Features:**

* Input features: income, debts, payment history, etc.
* Dataset sourced from financial records or synthetic datasets.

**Outcome:** Predict whether a user is creditworthy or not based on historical financial behavior.

## Task 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech

**Objective:** Recognize human emotions (e.g., happy, angry, sad) from speech audio.

**Approach:**

* Deep learning and speech signal processing.
* Extract features like MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients).
* Models: CNN, RNN, or LSTM.

**Dataset:** RAVDESS, TESS, EMO-DB.

**Outcome:** Detect and classify emotions from audio recordings with high accuracy.

## Task 3: Handwritten Character Recognition

**Objective:** Identify handwritten characters or alphabets.

**Approach:**

* Image processing and deep learning.
* Dataset: MNIST (digits), EMNIST (characters).
* Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
* Extendable to full word or sentence recognition using sequence models (e.g., CRNN).

**Outcome:** Predict handwritten characters with high accuracy for applications like digit recognition, form processing, and OCR.
